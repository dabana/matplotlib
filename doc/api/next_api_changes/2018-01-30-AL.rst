Minor Locator no longer try to avoid overstriking major Locators
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Previously, certain locator classes (`LogLocator`, `AutoMinorLocator`)
contained custom logic to avoid emitting tick locations that collided with
major ticks when they were used as minor locators.

This logic has now moved to the Axis class; thus, for example,
``xaxis.minor.locator()`` now includes positions that collide with
``xaxis.major.locator()``, but ``xaxis.get_minorticklocs()`` does not.
